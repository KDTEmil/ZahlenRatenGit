# ZahlenRatenGit

### This is a test for Git

main.py is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100. 
The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, 
and keeps track of the number of attempts. The game continues until the user 
guesses the correct number or chooses to quit.
